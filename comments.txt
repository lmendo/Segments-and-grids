- Buffon and Buffon-Laplace problems (https://www.ias.ac.in/article/fulltext/reso/003/09/0070-0073)

- Is "canonical rectangle" a good name? "Canonical" is close to what I wanted, but perhaps a better word can be found for "smallest and wih sides following grid lines"

- Are "sufficient" and "minimal sufficient" good names? They are used in statistics: analogously?

(Include a,b as subscripts of the functions? I don't think so; it would make notation heavier and it's usually clear what the valuees of a and b are)

Is the square case with a neq 1 y and integer lengths interesting? (I don't think so). And, would it be possible to generalize results from a=1, integer length to that case? Alex's formula maybe? That "2" multiplying L^2 looks moderately promising. From that the inverse formular could be derived. The properties about increments would change. Probably not very interesting
