- Buffon and Buffon-Laplace problems (https://www.ias.ac.in/article/fulltext/reso/003/09/0070-0073)

- Is "canonical rectangle" a good name? "Canonical" is close to what I wanted, but perhaps a better word can be found for "smallest and wih sides following grid lines"

- Are "sufficient" and "minimal sufficient" good names? They are used in statistics: analogously?

- (Include a,b as subscripts of the functions? I don't think so; it would make notation heavier and it's usually clear what the valuees of a and b are)

Things to do:
- Alex: write the proof for the square, integer length formula
- Alex: write the new proof for the average number of tiles
- Luis: fill in some intermediate steps in the proof of the asymptotic analysis of probmax
- Alex/Luis: come up with a simpler approach for the proof of Pr[max] = O(1/length), or else fill in some intermediate steps in the proof. It's tedious by hand, but Maple can help
- Luis: apply the two sets of structural changes (message by Luis, 26vii21), if Alex agrees
