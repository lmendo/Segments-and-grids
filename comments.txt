Things to do:
|- Is "canonical rectangle" a good name? "Canonical" is close to what I wanted, but perhaps a better word can be found for "smallest and wih sides following grid lines". Following Alex's proposal: "Discrete bounding rectangle"?
|- Are "sufficient" and "minimal sufficient" good names? They are used in statistics: analogously? These names are going to be removed.
|- Luis: check style uniformity in commit Sep 21, 2021
|- Luis: remove name "minimal suffucient set". Now that it's just a point in each diagonal, maybe we can refer to it just that way. I'll see how to reword to achieve that. Also, since the set of points is defined as "M" early on, we can use that notation without any specific name.
|- Luis: add "On Laplace’s Extension of the Buffon Needle Problem" and "Buffon's Noodle Problem" to the bibliography file, and let Alex know when done
|- Alex: rewrite (simplify) proof of average-length result (Theorem 6) using the two references of the Buffon Needle problem
|- Luis: new proof of the proposition that characterizes the minimal sufficient set, based on Alex's notes
|- Luis: comment that the floor and ceiling expressions (well, some of them) correspond to rounding with opposite tiebreaks. I think it's best to include that comment the first time that type of expression appears (I don't remember now where it is), and also in subsequent appearances (more briefly, as a quick mention referring to the first).
|- Luis: figure for the new proof of the proposition that characterizes of the minimal sufficient set. The figure will illustrate the continuous solution i,j, as intersection of two lines
|- Luis: unification of formulas in Theorem 2 and its proof, based on Alex's notes in his e-mail dated Sep 2, 2021.
|- Luis: comment after Theorem 2: how the new formula has two terms with definite meanings
|~ - Luis: move Figure 14 (graph of \probmax) closer to the statement of Theorem 7, since it nicely illustrates what the cases look like. There is not much margin for moving it, it seems, because the figure has to be after the theorem (and its proof).
|~ - Alex/Luis: see if the new formula for λ (arbitrary a,b; with the "r" term) can be turned into one for τ (maybe via the "inverse" relationship between λ and τ) which is simpler than the current formula in Theorem 1
- Alex/Luis: when the paper is finished, decide if we move all proofs to an appendix, for readability. Not sure
|- Luis: figure 12 ("Tiles in which the second endpoint can be for..."): the lines do not render well. Try dotted, or thicker
|- Luis: figure 12 ("Tiles in which the second endpoint can be for..."): it's not clear what happens with the symmetry for smaller t. Actually the symmetry is better understood as being around the lines x=1/2, y=1/2 (rather than x=0, y=0). Also, for small t the "problematic" tiles need not be considered. This is explained later ("This can only happen for...").  I'll add a comment to explain this a bit when that figure is introduced. Also, this justifies referring to the symmetry in terms of "quadrants", which is convenient, even if the symmetry is not around the lines x=0, y=0. I'll see how to express this more clearly.
|~ - Luis: clarify that \probmax in the jumps takes the value on the left, rather than 0 on the right. Include that as a comment near (right after?) "As $\len$ grows, $\probmax(\len)$ has a jump when the maximum number of tiles that can be visited increases by $1$." Also write that the value of ρ(l_t) is the chance that a segment *barely not long enough to visit t tiles* visits its maximum of t-1 tiles. And, naturally, this is the largest chance among segment lengths whose maximum is t-1 tiles visited. / I added the first part, but couldn't find a way to include the second pat and not be repetitive with what is already written.
|- Alex: write the proof for the square grid formula for maximum number of visited tiles (Theorem 3)
|- Alex: write the new proof for the average number of tiles, without using the proposition on the distribution if i, which is now after the theorem
|~ - Luis: fill in some intermediate steps in the proof of Pr[max] = O(1/length); or else . It's tedious by hand, but Maple can help
|- Luis: apply the structural changes (message by Luis, 26vii21:
 |- Theorem 3 will be replaced by your formula, and its derivation, for real-valued lengths. I don't think it's worth keeping the current formulas in Theorem 3, is it?. It turns out that it is, because i*, j* are used later.
 |- Corollary 2 should include the expression that unifies the odd and even cases with your ceiling function idea.
 |- The formula in Theorem 4 will now be the same as in new Theorem 3, just without the ceiling function. The actual content of the theorem will be the properties of the sequence T.
 |~ - Similarly, the expression in Theorem 5 will the same as in (modified) Corollary 2, just without the ceiling. Actually no, there's a "+1" due to the different definition (minimum instead of infimum) The main part of the theorem will be the properties of the sequence Λ. Since the properties of Λ are a direct consequence of those of T, perhaps Theorems 4 and 5 should be merged.
 |- Proposition 3 disappears
 |- The text after Proposition 3 should be maintained (reworded), or incorporated into Proposition 4. The bounding lines are used in subsequent proofs. We should make sure that (12) is exclusive and (13) is inclusive, because that is also used later.
 |- Current Proposition 4 will have the same statement, but with a proof based on Alex's finding for continuous i and j: starting from i = b^2/(a^2+b^2)*k, j = a^2/(a^2+b^2)*k, Proposition 4 is obtained by adjusting for the "-2" offset (i.e. add 2 to each expression and replace k by t-3) and then applying floor(...+1/2) to i and ceiling(...-1/2) to j. These rounding operations are equivalent to rounding to nearest, giving precedence to the pair with higher i in case of a tie
 |~ - The only new content in Section 3.3 is now the properties of the sequences (the formulas are now the same as those in Section 3.2). So perhaps Section 3.3 can be merged with Section 3.2
 |- Theorem 2 will now have a simpler formula. The current one should be kept because i*, j* are used later. The theorem will contain both formulas; they are actually related.
 |- Proposition 5 (Pr[i>=n]) will go after Theorem 5 (average number of tiles)
