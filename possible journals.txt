Publication fees: yo me ocupo

Published papers seem more advanced than ours. But we let's try and if rejected we can proceed with another journal


# Journals about mathematics of applied mathematics, Q2 and Q3 impact factor:

- SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics

- Journal of Applied Mathematics and Computing

- Revista Matematica Complutense

- Computational Methods in Applied Mathematics

- EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS

- Discrete Optimization
https://www.journals.elsevier.com/discrete-optimization
"integer programming and combinatorial optimization"
Not suited, in principle

- Results in Mathematics

- JOURNAL OF COMBINATORIAL OPTIMIZATION

- DISCRETE APPLIED MATHEMATICS
https://www.journals.elsevier.com/discrete-applied-mathematics
"algorithmic and applicable discrete mathematics as well as applications of combinatorial mathematics to informatics and various areas of science and technology"
Probably not very suited, jugding from titles of published papers

- Mathematical Communications: https://www.mathos.unios.hr/ "All fields of pure and applied mathematics"

- AIMS Mathematics: https://www.aimspress.com/journal/Math

--> Discrete & Computational Geometry
Impact factor 0.969. Q2 in Mathematics
https://www.springer.com/journal/454
covering a broad range of topics in which geometry plays a fundamental role
tiling covering geometric probability
From looking at some published papers, it seems like the subject of our paper could suit the journal, although the published papers seem more advanced

-> Advances in geometry
Impact factor 0.718. Q3 in mathematics.
https://www.degruyter.com/journal/key/advg/html
"publication of original research articles of excellent quality in the area of geometry"
"Discrete geometry" (which includes Packings, coverings and tilings)

- Journal of geometric analysis
Impact factor 1.183. Q2
"interface of analysis, geometry, and partial differential equations"
https://www.springer.com/journal/12220
Subject not very suited, it seems

- COMMUNICATIONS IN ANALYSIS AND GEOMETRY
Impact factor 0.736. Q3 in mathematics
https://www.intlpress.com/site/pub/pages/journals/items/cag/_home/_main/index.php
"classical analysis, partial differential equations, algebraic geometry, differential geometry, and topology"
Perhaps not very suited

- Open mathematics

- Discrete mathematics
Impact factor 0.87. Q3 in mathematics
https://www.journals.elsevier.com/discrete-mathematics
"...Discrete geometry... Papers focused primarily on applied problems or experimental results fall outside our scope"
Lines are very long
